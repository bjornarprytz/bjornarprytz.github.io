## Adam Curtis just released a new documentary series

"Back in the 1960s, as the engineers began to build the first neural networks, what they had forgotten was that the system of thought they were creating inside the machines _did_ have its own history - that it had been borne out of a time when science had become deeply involved in questions of power and control in the British Empire, and that what lay behind the computer logic was the aim of simplifying human thought, which would finally allow you to colonize the last free outpost - the human mind." - _[Can't get you out of my head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHFrhIAj0ME)_
