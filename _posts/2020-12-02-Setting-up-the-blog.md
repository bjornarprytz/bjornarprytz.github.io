# First things first

Goal: set up a blog where I can document my process

Wishlist for the blog

1. To use my favourite IDE for content creation
2. Minimal setup (domain, server, database, etc.)
3. Possibility to tinker with CSS

Lucky me, [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) led me down a very pleasant path:

1. Choose a [theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#pick-up-a-theme). I chose [hacker-blog](https://github.com/tocttou/hacker-blog) because it was easy to customize.
2. Fork the theme into your special Pages repository on github: _yourusername_.github.io
3. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) generates a static web page from [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/03-front-matter/)
4. Follow [this guide](https://jreel.github.io/social-media-icons-on-jekyll/) to add social media icons
