### Setting an achievable goal

The main goal is to learn how to finish a game. Any game.

What I need to achieve this:
1. A game idea
1. An engine ([Unity](https://unity.com/) | [Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/))

### Getting an idea

It would be good to start with something **turn-based**.
The game logic and state should be **discrete**, and not reliant on the engine itself.

I like [card](https://magic.wizards.com/) [games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) a lot, and [deck building](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion) is one of my favourite mechanics because it lends so much agency to the player.

In [tower](https://store.steampowered.com/app/93200/Revenge_of_the_Titans/) [defense](https://store.steampowered.com/app/246420/Kingdom_Rush___Tower_Defense/) games, there are interesting examples of resource management and puzzle-like level design.

### Choosing an engine

I want to learn [Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/). It is open source, and the [community](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/) seems like a happy and approachable bunch.
