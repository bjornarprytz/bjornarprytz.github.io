# Setting an achievable goal

The main goal is to learn how to finish a game. Any game.

What I need to achieve this:

1. A game idea
2. An engine ([Unity](https://unity.com/), [Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/))

## Getting an idea

[Card](https://magic.wizards.com/) [games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) inherently pit luck and strategy in a beautiful way. [Deck building](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion) is one of my favourite mechanics because it lets the player compose their own strategy. Combined with deck manipulation and card drawing, they also get fantastic tactical agency.

In [tower](https://store.steampowered.com/app/93200/Revenge_of_the_Titans/) [defense](https://store.steampowered.com/app/246420/Kingdom_Rush___Tower_Defense/) games, there are interesting examples of resource management and puzzle-like level design.

I think a roguelite tower defense would be cool combination:

- Get unique towers and modifications as reward
- Modify towers as you progress
- Resource gathering from sources on the map (which must be defended)

## Choosing an engine

I want to learn [Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/). It is open source, and the [community](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/) seems like a happy and approachable bunch.
