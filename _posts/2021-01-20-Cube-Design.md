# Cube Design

I've had an ongoing project designing and updating a [Magic: The Gathering cube](http://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/modernclassics). Every iteration feels like the definitive version, but there are always things to tweak, in order to improve the balance and draftability of the cube.

With the [Kaldheim full spoiler](https://scryfall.com/sets/khm?order=set&as=grid) available, I went through the list in order to shore up Gruul's identity and rework Selesnya.

## Drafting Strategy

### Gruul

- Focus on powerful creatures.
- The cheaper ones do not have as much toughness, so they will need some help from burn spells to clear out blockers.
- If you want card advantage, Furious Rise and Garruk's Uprising are perfect
- If you want to focus on even larger spells, you can draft mana ramp and the powerful kicker spells, along with self-mill and the more persistent elements of green. 
- It's also possible to gain an advantage from discard outlets and land recursion, though this path is quite narrow.

### Selesnya

- A fairly modular aggro strategy, but with pay-offs for +1/+1 counters.
- High reward for drafting 1 and 2 drops that protect themselves or each other (Adanto Vanguard / Alseid of Life's Bounty)
- Gain tempo advantage and outclass defenders by putting counters on key creatures.
