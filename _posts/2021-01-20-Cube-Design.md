# Cube Design

I've had an ongoing project designing and updating a [Magic: The Gathering cube](http://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/modernclassics). Every iteration feels like the definitive version, but there are always things to tweak, in order to improve the balance and draftability of the cube.

With the [Kaldheim full spoiler](https://scryfall.com/sets/khm?order=set&as=grid) available, I went through the list in order to update the cube :)

Also, [this](https://github.audio/) has provided amazing background ambient to my work this week :)
