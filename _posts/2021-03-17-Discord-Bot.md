# Making a Discord Bot

I want to set up a Discord Bot that can receive sensor data from an [Arduino with WiFi](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-wifi-rev2). The Arduino is in the mail, so I'm going to focus on the Discord Bot this week.

Ideally:

- The Arduino can use an API to transmit sensor data.
- The Bot can show graphs on a discord channel, following user prompts
  - Can [Grafana](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=grafana+board) be used here?
- I can host the bot on a local machine.

I'm going to start [here](https://discord.js.org/#/).
