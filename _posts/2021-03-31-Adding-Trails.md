# Trails

I'm jumping a lot between projects, and these posts aren't really doing a good job of documenting the work. That's why I've added [trails](../trails.md) to keep a separate, chronological record of each project that I'm working on.

I hope the trails will make it easier to get into the context of projects I haven't worked on in a while.
