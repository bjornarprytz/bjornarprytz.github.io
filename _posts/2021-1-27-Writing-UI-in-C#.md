# Goal for the day

I'm going to re-write the UI for Plapp in C\#.

1. Started with this [intro](https://github.com/VincentH-Net/CSharpForMarkup).
2. Updated to Xamarin.Forms 5 and Installed the [Xamarin Community Toolkit](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/xamarin-communitytoolkit/blob/68fe0de991a99b364ed61e19bc280e3da94ff02e/docs/markup.md).
3. Ended up using many of the [MSDN docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/collectionview/populate-data), which were great.

It turns out there's a lot to learn with C\# UI, but I'm making headway.

Some benefits I see to doing this:

1. Actual help from Intellisense.
2. Extension methods for UI expressions!!
3. Breakpoints in UI creation.
