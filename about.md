## The Twenty Percent

I have dedicated twenty percent of my work to personal projects.
This blog is a tool to document my goals and the progress towards them.

### My over-arching goals are to
1.  Use existing technology wherever possible
1.  Contribute to open source
1.  Work on projects I can finish
1.  Abandon projects that get out of control
