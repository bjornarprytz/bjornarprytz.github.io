## The Twenty Percent

I have dedicated twenty percent of my work to personal projects.
This blog is a tool to document my goals and the steps I take towards them.
Reaching the initial goal is not so important.

### My over-arching goals are
1.  Use existing technology wherever possible
1.  Contribute to open source
1.  Keep scope managable
